## How to Install (without Docker)

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (For Angular)
- **SQL Server** (For database)
- **.NET 6.0 SDK** (For ASP.NET Core)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codebangla/invoicika.git
   cd invoicika
   ```

2. **Frontend (Angular)**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ng serve
   ```

3. **Backend (ASP.NET Core)**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. **Database Setup (SQL Server)**:

   - Ensure SQL Server is installed and running.
   - Update the connection strings in `appsettings.json` to configure your SQL Server database.
   
     Example:
     ```json
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "SqlServerConnection": "Your SQL Server connection string"
     }
     ```

5. **Apply Migrations**:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Run the **Angular frontend**:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

2. Run the **ASP.NET Core backend**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

    3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` for the frontend. Login with `username: admin1, password: admin1` as admin or `username: employee1, password: employee1` as employee. The backend is at `http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html`

4. To use SMTP with Outlook, you need to generate an app password if two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on your Microsoft account. Follow this [guide on how to get an app password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/how-to-get-and-use-app-passwords-5896ed9b-4263-e681-128a-a6f2979a7944) for detailed steps.

   
   Make sure to replace the `"Password"` field in your `appsettings.js` with your generated app password.
   In your `appsettings.js` file, use the following format to configure the SMTP server:

```json
{
  Email": {
    "SmtpServer": "smtp.office365.com",
    "SmtpPort": 587,
    "SenderEmail": "your-email@outlook-or-hotmail.com",
    "SenderName": "Invoicika Team",
    "SenderPassword": "your-app-password"
  }
}
