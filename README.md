## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (For Angular)
- **MySQL** or **SQL Server** (For database)
- **.NET 6.0 SDK** (For ASP.NET Core)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/invoicika.git
   cd invoicika
   ```

4. **Database Setup**:

   - Ensure either MySQL or SQL Server is installed and running.
   - Update the connection strings in `appsettings.json` to configure the database you want to use.
   - Use the `DatabaseProvider` key in `appsettings.json` to switch between MySQL and SQL Server.
   
     Example:
     ```json
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "SqlServerConnection": "Your SQL Server connection string",
       "MySqlConnection": "Your MySQL connection string"
     },
     "DatabaseProvider": "SqlServer" // Or "MySql"
     ```

5. **Apply Migrations**:
   - SQL Server:
     ```bash
     dotnet ef database update --context ApplicationDbContext -- --provider SqlServer
     ```

     ```bash
     dotnet ef database update --context ApplicationDbContext -- --provider MySql
     ```
